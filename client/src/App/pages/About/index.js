                <p className="about">I believe that each person has innate worth and the ability to grow toward personal fulfillment. My work as a therapist is centered on helping people find meaning, purpose, and creative expression of their core self. I like to start by providing a safe, peaceful, and non-judgmental space for clients to discover and make connections with their inner wisdom.</p>
            
                <p className="about">I draw from Jungian Psychology and use mindfulness and acceptance techniques to bring transformation. This approach employs the use of imagination, dreams, fantasies, creativity, spirituality and the unconscious psyche to bring about understanding the real life issues clients bring to therapy.</p> 

                <p className="about">I hold a Master's Degree in Counseling from Portland State University, presently engaging in a licensure internship. Major course work and focus has included personality traits, career development and lifestyle counseling, group theory, mindfulness and Jungian psychoanalysis.</p> 

                <p className="about">I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
